# CRUD operations using JsonPowerDB

#### In this project I have created a student site using HTML form that will perform CRUD oprations using JsonPowerDB.

##### What is JsonPowerDB?
JsonPowerDB is a Database Server with Developer friendly REST API services. It's a High Performance, Light Weight, Ajax Enabled, Serverless, Simple to Use, Real-time Database.

Easy and fast to develop database applications without using any server side programming / scripting or without installing any kind of database.

Whether it's a Dynamic Website or a Mobile App or some Data Analytics Portal, the development is real fun and fast. Nothing better than trying it yourself. What all you need is a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.

Benefits of using JPDB:

- JsonPowerDB (JPDB) is Next Generation, Creative and Disruptive Multi-mode DBMS_ with many USPs.
- Proprietary algorithm for High Performance CRUD operations. Multiple times faster than popular DBMS.
